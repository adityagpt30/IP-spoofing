Created a TCP connection to a local system on the LAN from a
non-existent IP address. Now, this means we will be spoofing the
connection, only not blind spoofing unfortunately. The use of this is solely educational. I think it's exciting cause this TCP theory is what I learned a long time ago and this is the most real example of the TCP handshake I've ever seen :-).
